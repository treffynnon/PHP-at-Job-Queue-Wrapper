# PHP at Job Queue Wrapper

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/treffynnon/PHP-at-Job-Queue-Wrapper.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/treffynnon/PHP-at-Job-Queue-Wrapper)

A PHP class to wrap the Unix/Linux at/atd job queue. At allows you to specify a job that the system should run at certain point in time. For more information on at either run `man at` in your console or visit [man page][man-page] This class lets you add new items to the queue either as a command or a path to a file and it can also give you back a list of the jobs already in the queue. You have the option to supply a queue letter that the wrapper should use so you can seperate out your jobs. For example::

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
use Treffynnon\At\Wrapper as At

// create a command job
$job = 'echo "hello" | wall';
$time = 'now + 1min';
// save command job to queue letter c
$queue = 'c';
At::cmd($job, $time, $queue);

// create a file job
$job = '/home/example/example.sh';
// save file job to queue letter f
$queue = 'f';
At::file($job, $time, $queue);

// create a file job and send it to
// the default queue (determined by at)
At::file($job, $time);

// get a list of all the jobs in the queue
var_dump(At::lq());

// get a list of all the jobs in the f queue
var_dump(At::lq('f'));

// get a list of all the jobs in the c queue
var_dump(At::listQueue('c'));
```

## Requires

* Unix/Linux
* at (`sudo apt-get install at`)
* PHP 5.6 and above due to the use of namespaces in the code


## Running the Tests

To run the test you will need to install the PHPUnit framework, which is easily done via PEAR. Once PHPUnit is installed you can simply run:

    phpunit tests

from the root directory of the at Job Queue Wrapper.


## Troubleshooting Failed Tests

The tests may fail if your version of `at` outputs differently when a new job is added or when the `at` queue is listed. The class has to long but simple regular expressions defined as properties in it. With a little knowledge of regex you can modify these to suit the output of the `at` binary on your operating system.

If you find that you need to modify these regexs then please lodge a ticket on [github][github].


## Currently Tested Output Styles

### Redhat

#### Add job

    [root@server home]#  echo 'echo "hello" \| wall' | at now +10min
    job 3 at 2010-11-15 10:54


#### List queue

    [root@server home]# at -l
    2       2010-11-15 10:53 a root
    3       2010-11-15 10:54 a root


### Ubuntu

#### Add job

    user@server:~$ echo 'echo "hello" \| wall' | at now +10min
    warning: commands will be executed using /bin/sh
    job 17 at Mon Nov 15 10:55:00 2010


#### List queue

    user@server:~$ at -l
    17      Mon Nov 15 10:55:00 2010 a simon
    18      Mon Nov 15 10:55:00 2010 a simon
